<p>You are being asked to be in a research study of human memory and cognition
  and how these processes are implemented in the brain because you are an adult
  over the age of 18.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The purpose of this study is to investigate how you process, learn, or remember
information. To do so, we have developed behavioral tasks that test different
cognitive processes by measuring decisions that you make and how long it takes
to make them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you decide to volunteer, we will ask you fill out a demographic form prior
  to starting the experiment. Completion of this form is optional. No identifying
  information will be collected as part of this online research study. Your data will
  be linked to a code, which may be able to be used to identify you. However, keys
  to identities will be kept entirely separate from the experimental data in
  password-protected computers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this study, you will see/hear pictures, sounds, videos, sentences and/or words
  shown to you on your computer. You will be asked to make decisions about what
  you see or hear and to make responses to the stimuli by either pressing a button
  or by making a short written response. This version of the study will additionally
  include unpleasant words, like "angry" or "scorpion."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<!-- remember to enter the time it takes to complete the study!!! -->
<p>The study will take 30 minutes to complete.</p>

helped further the scholarly work in this research area. Choosing to be in this
study is voluntary. If you choose not to be in this study, it will not
affect your current or future relations with the University, and there is no
penalty or loss of benefits. You are free to quit at any time, for whatever

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You will be compensated 1 psychology research credit per hour of testing. You
  will be compensated at the end of the your participation in the study. If you
  choose to withdraw early from the study, any credit or monetary compensation
  will be adjusted for the amount of time that was spent in study.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
