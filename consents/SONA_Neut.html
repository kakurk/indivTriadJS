<p><b>Informed Consent to be in Study:</b></p>

<p>Online studies of memory and cognition</p>

<p><b>Researcher:</b> Maureen Ritchey, Ph.D.</p>

<p><b>Please read the following information carefully before deciding whether to
  participate in this experiment.</b></p>

<div style = "text-align: left">

  <p>You are being asked to be in a research study of human memory and cognition
    and how these processes are implemented in the brain because you are an adult
    over the age of 18.</p>

  <p>The purpose of this study is to investigate how you process, learn, or remember
  information. To do so, we have developed behavioral tasks that test different
  cognitive processes by measuring decisions that you make and how long it takes
  to make them.</p>

  <p>If you decide to volunteer, we will ask you fill out a demographic form prior
    to starting the experiment. Completion of this form is optional. No identifying
    information will be collected as part of this online research study. Your data will
    be linked to a code, which may be able to be used to identify you. However, keys
    to identities will be kept entirely separate from the experimental data in
    password-protected computers.</p>

  <p>In this study, you will see/hear pictures, sounds, videos, sentences and/or words
    shown to you on your computer. You will be asked to make decisions about what
    you see or hear and to make responses to the stimuli by either pressing a button
    or by making a short written response.</p>

  <!-- remember to enter the time it takes to complete the study!!! -->
  <p>The study will take 30 minutes to complete.</p>

  <p>There are
  no direct benefits to you, but you may feel gratified in knowing that you
  helped further the scholarly work in this research area. Choosing to be in this
  study is voluntary. If you choose not to be in this study, it will not
  affect your current or future relations with the University, and there is no
  penalty or loss of benefits. You are free to quit at any time, for whatever
  reason.</p>

  <p>The risks
  of participating in this study are minimal. The visual and auditory stimuli
  will not be painful or damaging. A possible discomfort is that you may feel
  fatigued after a long study. If you become upset or frustrated by the
  experiment, we encourage you to take breaks, and you can withdraw from the
  study at any time. There may be other risks that are unknown at this time.</p>

  <p>You will be compensated 1 psychology research credit per hour of testing. You
    will be compensated at the end of the your participation in the study. If you
    choose to withdraw early from the study, any credit or monetary compensation
    will be adjusted for the amount of time that was spent in study.</p>
