<div class=WordSection1>

<p style = "line-hight: 1.2em">The following passage is adapted from a speech delivered by Congresswoman Barbara Jordan
of Texas on July 25, 1974. She was a member of the Judiciary Committee of the
United States House of Representatives. In the passage, Jordan discusses how and
when a United States president may be impeached, or charged with serious offenses
while in office. Jordan’s speech was delivered in the context of impeachment
hearings against then President Richard M. Nixon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Today, I am an inquisitor. An hyperbole would not be
fictional and would not overstate the solemnness that I feel
right now. My faith in the Constitution is whole; it is
complete; it is total. And I am not going to sit here and be an
idle spectator to the diminution, the subversion, the
destruction, of the Constitution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>“Who can so properly be the inquisitors for the nation as
the representatives of the nation themselves?” “The subjects of
its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the
misconduct of public men.”* And that’s what we’re talking
about. In other words, [the jurisdiction comes] from the abuse
or violation of some public trust.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>It is wrong, I suggest, it is a misreading of the Constitution
for any member here to assert that for a member to vote for an
article of impeachment means that that member must be
convinced that the President should be removed from office.
The Constitution doesn’t say that. The powers relating to
impeachment are an essential check in the hands of the body
of the legislature against and upon the encroachments of the
executive. The division between the two branches of the
legislature, the House and the Senate, assigning to the one the
right to accuse and to the other the right to judge—the
framers of this Constitution were very astute. They did not
make the accusers and the judges . . . the same person.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>We know the nature of impeachment. We’ve been talking
about it a while now. It is chiefly designed for the President
and his high ministers to somehow be called into account. It is
designed to “bridle” the executive if he engages in excesses. “It
is designed as a method of national inquest into the conduct
of public men.”* The framers confided in the Congress the
power, if need be, to remove the President in order to strike a
delicate balance between a President swollen with power and
grown tyrannical, and preservation of the independence of
the executive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The nature of impeachment: a narrowly <b>channeled</b>
exception to the separation of powers maxim. The Federal
Convention of 1787 said that. It limited impeachment to high
crimes and misdemeanors, and discounted and opposed the
term “maladministration.” “It is to be used only for great
misdemeanors,” so it was said in the North Carolina
ratification convention. And in the Virginia ratification
convention: “We do not trust our liberty to a particular
branch. We need one branch to check the other.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>. . . The North Carolina ratification convention: “No one
need be afraid that officers who commit oppression will pass
with immunity.” “Prosecutions of impeachments will seldom
fail to agitate the passions of the whole community,” said
Hamilton in the Federalist Papers, Number 65. “We divide
into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused.”
I do not mean political parties in that sense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The drawing of political lines goes to the motivation
behind impeachment; but impeachment must proceed within
the confines of the constitutional term “high crime[s] and
misdemeanors.” Of the impeachment process, it was
Woodrow Wilson who said that “Nothing short of the grossest
offenses against the plain law of the land will suffice to give
them speed and effectiveness. Indignation so great as to
overgrow party interest may secure a conviction; but nothing
else can.”<p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Common sense would be revolted if we engaged upon this
process for petty reasons. Congress has a lot to do:
appropriations, tax reform, health insurance, campaign
finance reform, housing, environmental protection, energy
sufficiency, mass transportation. Pettiness cannot be allowed
to stand in the face of such overwhelming problems. So today
we’re not being petty. We’re trying to be big, because the task
we have before us is a big one.<p>
